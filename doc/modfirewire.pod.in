=head1 NAME

modfirewire - reload FireWire camera kernel modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

modfirewire COMMAND

=head1 DESCRIPTION

FireWire acquisition can be quite fragile under Linux: a badly written
program or an unexpected program exit can let the FireWire grabbing
system in a state where grabbing is difficult to resume. To
work-around these problems, this script reloads the kernel modules
related to FireWire and FireWire cameras to make sure grabbing
capabilities can be restored safely.

Please, keep in mind that this script is only a work-around and cannot
replace robust frame-grabbing.


B<Important:> this script has to be run as root to work.


=head1 COMMANDS

B<l> , B<load>		load kernel modules
B<u> , B<unload>	unload kernel modules
B<r> , B<restart>	restart kernel modules
B<v> , B<version>	display software version
B<h> , B<help>	 	produce help message


=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Several environment variables can customize this script behavior:

B<INSMOD>, B<RMMOD> and B<MODPROBE> can be used to specify how to call
insmod, rmmod and modprobe.

The list of loaded/unloaded kernel modules can be overloaded by
B<MODFIREWIRE_MODULES>.
The default list is: "ieee1394 ohci1394 raw1394 video1394".
Modules will be loaded using the left-to-right order and unloaded
using the right-to-left order.
