=head1 NAME

llvs-server - the low-level vision server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

llvs-server [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The low-level vision server provides a service for non-interactive
image processing. Image processing is represented by a graph where the
input symbolizes the image acquisition device such as camera and
output the processing results.

llvs has been designed to easily interact with dynamic-graph/stack of
tasks framework.


=head1 OPTIONS

B<-fg> enable the frame-grabbing mode

B<-sim> enable the simulator mode (connects to OpenHRP to grab images)

B<-synchro> specify the synchronization mode for image acquisition
            (trigger or flow)

=head1 EXAMPLES

To grab for live images, no options are required:

          llvs-server


To grab from an OpenHRP simulation, the simulation has to be enabled:

          llvs-server -sim

The image are transferred through CORBA which might induce a delay
between the simulation and the real image processing.
